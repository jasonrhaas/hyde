###School

I studied Electrical Engineering at Lehigh Univerisity and received by BS and MS there.  Which means basically that I can solve complex problems using very complicated math (woo hoo).

###Systems Engineering

I moved on to System Engineering.  Finally a practical use for some of the skills I learned in school!  I focused on mostly radio frequency systems, and got involved with the super secret word of signal intelligence.  While this was fun, the constanst need for security and secrecy got old.

###Linux geru/open-source software junkie

I started learning about Linux, open-source software, `git`, `bash`, `perl`, and `python` when I was at my last job.  I was fascinated by it and wanted to continue to learn more but was always pulled back into my normal job duties.  I especially liked text parsing, regex, and anything that can be done on the command line.  Right now I am involved in data mining, cloud computing, big data streams and databases, and writing (mostly) python code to make it all happen.

###Side projects

Some side projects I want to work on:

* Program a [Slack](http://slack.com) Bot to respond to people for me
* Have monitoring scripts on servers send notificatiions via a Slack Bot
* Plug into my Roomba API and make it do evil things
* Get an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) and see what havac I can wreak
* Become a Pythonista!
